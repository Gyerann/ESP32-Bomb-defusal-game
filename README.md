# ESP32-IDF-Bomb-defusal-game  
A bomb defusal game on real hardware  
  
The game is based on Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.  
Goal of the project is to develop a real life bomb defusal game that plays similar to the pc counterpart.
Circuit diagrams, parts used and documentation will be uploaded as I continue development.
